# QOSFScreeningTask
Screening Task (#3, QSVM) for the QOSF Mentorship cohort spring 2023


Last minute notes:
- I decided to employ two different kernels: 
--- once a very classic oriented vanilla amplitude embedding kernel (the smallest and the strongest classifier in my trials)
--- once a more verbose quantum kernel, that reflects my best knowledge of how to guess something like that. (still reasonably small and strong).
